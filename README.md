# Particle physics data-analysis with CMS open data
This repository contains material for the exercise where real data from CMS experiment at CERN is used
for a simple particle physics data-analysis. There are two easy ways to get the exercise working:

### monty.stfc.ac.uk Users
If you are reading this after having logged onto https://monty.stfc.ac.uk just click on Exercise.ipynb to start the computer exercise and read no further


### 1) Opening the exercise with Binder

With Binder it is easy to make Jupyter Notebook files interactive in the browser without any installing. Just open the badge [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/olaiya/zboson-exercise/master?filepath=Exercise.ipynb)  in the new browser tab to create the Binder environment. When Binder has finished building the interactive environment, it will automatically show the contents of the repository. The
exercise can be started by clicking the "Exercise.ipynb" file in the Binder environment.

If the badge isn't working, you can set the Binder environment manually. Go to <https://mybinder.org/> and paste the URL of this repository (https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/olaiya/zboson-exercise/master?filepath=Exercise.ipynb)
into the field "GitHub repository name or URL". After that click the "launch" button and wait a moment for Binder to create the environment.

Note that the Binder environment is just temporary and will be deleted after you choose to close the exercise.

### 2) Opening the exercise with Google Colab (need a Google account) <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/olaiya/zboson-exercise/blob/colab/Exercise.ipynb">

</a>

Using Google Colab you will need a Google account. However, there are some big benefits with this option. Your work is stored (on your Google Drive), so you can return to where you left off at another time. You also have access to more powerful GPU and CPU resources. This would be a good place to set up your own projects for analysing data!

### 3) Downloading the material to be opened with Jupyter Notebook

Another way to open the exercise is to download the repository to your computer and then use Jupyter Notebook to open the 
exercise. This way requires that you have installed Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/) to your computer.

The contents of the repository can be downloaded by clicking the green _Clone or download_ button on the main page of
the repository. Note that all files of the repository have to be in the same directory in the computer.
