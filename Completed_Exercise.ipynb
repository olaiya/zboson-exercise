    "#### Equation for invariant mass\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we derive loosely the equation for the invariant mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have a particle with mass $M$ and energy $E$ which decays to two particles with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, and energies $E_1$ and $E_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Energy $E$ and momentum $\\vec{p}$ are conserved in the decay process so\n",
    "\n",
    "$E = E_1 +E_2$ and $\\vec{p} = \\vec{p}_1+ \\vec{p}_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particles will obey the relativistic dispersion relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Mc^2 = \\sqrt{E^2 - c^2\\vec{p}^2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And with the conservation of energy and momentum this can be shown as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Mc^2 = \\sqrt{(E_1+E_2)^2 - c^2(\\vec{p_1} + \\vec{p_2})^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "$$\n",
    "=\\sqrt{E_1^2+2E_1E_2+E_2^2 -c^2\\vec{p_1}^2-2c^2\\vec{p_1}\\cdot\\vec{p_2}-c^2\\vec{p_2}^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "=\\sqrt{2E_1E_2 - 2c^2 |\\vec{p_1}||\\vec{p_2}|\\cos(\\theta)+m_1^2c^4+m_2^2c^4}. \\qquad (1)\n",

    "\n",
    "The relativistic dispersion relation can be brought to the following format\n",

    "For those that like maths, a fuller derivation of this can be found <a href=\"images/Invariant_mass.pdf\"> here </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to do this in python\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, you only need to write a proper equation once - since the code executes the equation automatically for each row of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if you would like to sum the electrical charges of two muons for each event and save results in a variable _charges_, it could be done with the following code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "charges = ds.Q1 + ds.Q2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have to tell in the code that Q1 and Q2 refer to values in the variable `ds`. This can be done by adding the variable name separated with a dot in front of the value that is wanted, as in the example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can use 'sqrt'  from the _numpy_ module that we named as _np_. You can get a square root with the function `np.sqrt()`.  Naturally inside the brackets there will be anything that is inside the square root or brackets in the equation too.\n",
    "\n",
    "__In the cell below write code__ that will calculate the invariant mass value for muon pairs in each collision event in the data file. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to use the muons energy and momentum and then use equation 2 to calculate the invariant mass of the parent particle:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy of each particle can be calculated from:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_1^2 = \\vec{p_1}^2 + m_{1}^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that momentum is a vector so:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{p_1}^2 = (p_1^x)^2 +  (p_1^y)^2 +  (p_1^z)^2 \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_1^x$ is the $x$-component of the momentum of particle 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the values calculated in a variable called `invariant_mass`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some comments in the cell below to help you with the different steps.\n",
    "There are also some hints - only use these if you are really stuck!\n",

As the Z boson is not stable and decays we can identify the Z boson by its decay to two leptons as above. Consequently the Higgs boson can end up decaying to 4 leptons. We can look at the final states electron-positron and electron-positron ($e^+ e^- e^+ e^-$), electron-positron and muon-antimuon ($e^+ e^- \\mu^+ \\mu^-$) as well as $\\mu^+ \\mu^- \\mu^+ \\mu^-$\n",

    "    From the histograms one can see that the events where the pseudorapidity of both of the muons is small, produces a narrower peak than the events where the muons have large  pseudorapidities. That means that the <b> resolution </b> of the invariant masses is worse with larger pseudorapidities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The worse resolution follows from the fact that the resolution of the transverse momentum ($p_T$ , the component of momentum that is perpendicular to the particle beams) is worse for muons with greater pseudorapidities. This can be seen for example from image 21 on page 32 of the CMS paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.4071.pdf\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The explanation for the effect of the pseudorapidity on the resolution is that the particles which enter the endcap of the detector (larger pseudorapidities) will more probably interact with the material of the detector than the muons with smaller pseudorapidities (check the image 8). In these interactions muons will lose some of their energy. This messes up slightly the fitting of the trajectories of the muons and the measurement of the transverse momentum. The measurement of the transverse momentum also depends on, for example, the orientation of the muon chambers, the amount of material in the detector and the magnetic field. It can be assumed that these things are worse known for particles that have larger pseudorapidities.\n",

The histogram that was created earlier will help in this task.\n",

The uncertainties will be received from the covariance matrix that the fitting function `curve_fit` will return."
