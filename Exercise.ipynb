    "Let's assume we have a particle with mass $M$ and energy $E$ which decays to two particles with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, and energies $E_1$ and $E_2$. Energy $E$ and momentum $\\vec{p}$ is conserved in the decay process so $E = E_1 +E_2$ and $\\vec{p} = \\vec{p}_1+ \\vec{p}_2$.\n",

    "charges = ds.Q1 + ds.Q2\n",
    "```\n",

    "So you have to tell in the code that Q1 and Q2 refer to values in the variable `ds`. This can be done by adding the variable name separated with a dot in front of the value that is wanted, as in the example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can use 'sqrt'  from the _numpy_ module that we named as _np_. You can get a square root with the function `np.sqrt()`.  Naturally inside the brackets there will be anything that is inside the square root or brackets in the equation too.\n",
    "\n",
    "__In the cell below write code__ that will calculate the invariant mass value for muon pairs in each collision event in the data file. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to use the muons energy and momentum and then use equation 2 to calculate the invariant mass of the parent particle:\n",
    "\n",

    "The energy of each particle can be calculated from:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_1^2 = \\vec{p_1}^2 + m_{1}^2\n",

    "Remember that momentum is a vector so:\n",

    "Now that we can reconstruct invariant masses we can look to find the mass of the Higgs via its decay to two Z bosons. As the Z boson is not stable and decays we can identfiy the Z boson by its decay to two leptons as above. Consequently the Higgs boson can end up decaying to 4 leptons. We can look at the final states electron-positron and electron-positron ($e^+ e^- e^+ e^-$), electron-positron and muon-antimuon ($e^+ e^- \\mu^+ \\mu^-$) as well as $\\mu^+ \\mu^- \\mu^+ \\mu^-$\n",

    "To calculate the invariant mass of the Higgs we need to know the mass of the particles in the final state. There are three different mass configurations here so three different calculations. We could look at the invariant mass distribution of each state and then add them together to get the final distribution. But because these are high energy collisions, the masses of the electron and muon and very small compared to the momentum of the partciles: "

    "    From the histograms one can see that the events where the pseudorapidity of both of the muons is small, produces a narrower peak than the events where the muons have large  pseudorapidities. That means that the <b> resolution </b> of the invariant masses is worse with larger pseudorapidities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The worse resolution follows from the fact that the resolution of the transverse momentum ($p_T$ , the component of momentum that is perpendicular to the particle beams) is worse for muons with greater pseudorapidities. This can be seen for example from image 21 on page 32 of the CMS paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.4071.pdf\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The explanation for the effect of the pseudorapidity on the resolution is that the particles which enter the endcap of the detector (larger pseudorapidities) will more probably interact with the material of the detector than the muons with smaller pseudorapidities (check the image 8). In these interactions muons will lose some of their energy. This messes up slightly the fitting of the trajectories of the muons and the measurement of the transverse momentum. The measurement of the transverse momentum also depends on, for example, the orientation of the muon chambers, the amount of material in the detector and the magnetic field. It can be assumed that these things are worse known for particles that have larger pseudorapidities.\n",

The histogram that was created earlier will help in this task.\n",
