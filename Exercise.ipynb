    "    From the histograms one can see that the events where the pseudorapidity of both of the muons is small, produces a narrower peak than the events where the muons have large  pseudorapidities. That means that the <b> resolution </b> of the invariant masses is worse with larger pseudorapidities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The worse resolution follows from the fact that the resolution of the transverse momentum ($p_T$ , the component of momentum that is perpendicular to the particle beams) is worse for muons with greater pseudorapidities. This can be seen for example from image 21 on page 32 of the CMS paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.4071.pdf\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The explanation for the effect of the pseudorapidity on the resolution is that the particles which enter the endcap of the detector (larger pseudorapidities) will more probably interact with the material of the detector than the muons with smaller pseudorapidities (check the image 8). In these interactions muons will lose some of their energy. This messes up slightly the fitting of the trajectories of the muons and the measurement of the transverse momentum. The measurement of the transverse momentum also depends on, for example, the orientation of the muon chambers, the amount of material in the detector and the magnetic field. It can be assumed that these things are worse known for particles that have larger pseudorapidities.\n",
