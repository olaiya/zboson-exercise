    "We have just seen we can identify particles by reconstructing the invariant mass of the particles they decay to. We can look at any of these particles and study its properties. For example lets focus on the Z boson. In practice the identification of the Z boson goes in the following way. The invariant mass for two muons is calculated for the great amount of collision events. Then a histogram is made from the calculated values. The histogram shows how many invariant mass values will be in each bin of the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a peak (many invariant mass values near the same bin compared to other bins) is formed in the histogram, it can prove that in the collision events there has been a particle with a mass that corresponds to the peak. After that it is possible to fit a function to the histogram and determine the mass and the lifetime of the Z from the parameters of the fitted function. In the histogram we plotted the invariant mass was calculated for us. Let's calculate the invariant mass ourselves"

    "    From the histograms one can see that the events where the pseudorapidity of both of the muons is small, produces a narrower peak than the events where the muons have large  pseudorapidities. That means that the <b> resolution </b> of the invariant masses is worse with larger pseudorapidities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The worse resolution follows from the fact that the resolution of the transverse momentum ($p_T$ , the component of momentum that is perpendicular to the particle beams) is worse for muons with greater pseudorapidities. This can be seen for example from image 21 on page 32 of the CMS paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.4071.pdf\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The explanation for the effect of the pseudorapidity on the resolution is that the particles which enter the endcap of the detector (larger pseudorapidities) will more probably interact with the material of the detector than the muons with smaller pseudorapidities (check the image 8). In these interactions muons will lose some of their energy. This messes up slightly the fitting of the trajectories of the muons and the measurement of the transverse momentum. The measurement of the transverse momentum also depends on, for example, the orientation of the muon chambers, the amount of material in the detector and the magnetic field. It can be assumed that these things are worse known for particles that have larger pseudorapidities.\n",
