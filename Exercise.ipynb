    "We have just seen we can identify particles by reconstructing the invariant mass of the particles they decay to. We can look at any of these particles and study its properties. For example lets focus on the Z boson. In practice the identification of the Z boson goes in the following way. The invariant mass for two muons is calculated for the great amount of collision events. Then a histogram is made from the calculated values. The histogram shows how many invariant mass values will be in each bin of the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a peak (many invariant mass values near the same bin compared to other bins) is formed in the histogram, it can prove that in the collision events there has been a particle with a mass that corresponds to the peak. After that it is possible to fit a function to the histogram and determine the mass and the lifetime of the Z from the parameters of the fitted function. In the histogram we plotted the invariant mass was calculated for us. Let's calculate the invariant mass ourselves"

    "\n",
    "Now that we can reconstruct invariant masses we can look to find the mass of the Higgs via its decay to two Z bosons. As the Z boson is not stable and decays we can identfiy the Z boson by its decay to two leptons as above. Consequently the Higgs boson can end up decaying to 4 leptons. We can look at the final states electron-positron and electron-positron, electron-positron and muon- muon+ as well as muon- muon+ muon- muon+\n",

We could look at the invariant mass distribution of each state and then add them together to get the final distribution  "

    "Alternatively, because these are high energy collisions the momentum of the muons and electron is much higher than its mass. Therefore the mass contibution to energy is negligible, so we can just set the mass of the electron and muon to zero. Now we can add all the electron-positron and electron-positron, electron-positron and muon- muon+ as well as muon- muon+ muon- muon+ data together as their only physical difference is their mass and we have set this to zero. Have a try! Calculate the invariant mass of all the datasets in one go!"

In these interactions muons will lose some of their energy. This messes up slightly the fitting of the trajectories of the muons and the measurement of the transverse momentum. It also effects to the situation that the measurement of the transverse momentum is easily depended for example from the orientation of the muon chambers, from the division of the material of the detector and from the magnetic field.
